### Given that this is my own work, I am making this repo public. Anything that isn't part of an assignment is written explicitly for myself, so don't expect it to be readable.

### If you are also taking the CIS505 course at KSU, I highly recommend focusing on your own code, but feel free to use this as a reference.

This repo contains all work I will be doing for the CIS505 - programming languages class for the fall semester of 2023.

I am taking this clas with Torben Amtoft, who I would recommned as an instructor.
